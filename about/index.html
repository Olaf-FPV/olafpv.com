                Hi, I'm Olaf Hichwa, founder and lead engineer of OlaFPV.
            </span>
            I've been flying radio control since I was 8 years old. I bought my first racing drone when I was 13 (in
            2014) after watching <a class="lowkey-url" target="_blank"
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwL0t5kPf6E&feature=youtu.be">this</a> video. Ever since then, I
            have pushed
            RC tech to the limit and worked to make FPV
            easier for everyone. In 2017, I ranked 3rd on MultiGPâ€™s UTT 4 global leaderboard and started my racing
            career. I designed my first drone circuit board in early 2018 when I was 16, and brought a version of it to
            market later that year as the VTX Assassin.

            <span class="has-text-weight-bold">OlaFPV is focused on innovation in the FPV industry.</span> OlaFPV is
            based in the USA, where its extensive RnD is done 100% by members of the drone community. Since OlaFPV is
            rooted in the drone racing community, its products accurately reflect the industry's needs and
            stay relevant in such a fast-paced environment.
